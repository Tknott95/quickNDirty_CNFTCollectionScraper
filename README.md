# Scrapers

made this fast to train some ai back 8 months or so ago. I made a quick and dirty script, curling all urls with a bash script, to then use haskell. This is ugly, anbd I would recomend using haskell only for everything. I was doing this fast and just grabbing data. It is also better to utilize mapConcurrrently over concurrent nesting as that is ugly code.
